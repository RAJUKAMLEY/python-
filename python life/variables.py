a = 10 #10 is value 'a' is variable the value 10 is stored in 'a'
print(a) # then we can write print statement we can call print statement

x = y = z =30 # we don't use keywords in variable because key words have special characters
print(x,y,z) # we will get same values because we have same values 
# name = "string" # keywords like 'if' 'for' 'while' 'range' 'return'--etc..
# user_name = "raju" #variable name should be in meaningfull even we cannot use symbols and numbers
# multiple values asign we can write 
# multiple variables how to pass multiple values
a , b , c = 1 , 2 , 3 # a will store 1 b will be 2 c will be 3 because sequency
print (a,b,c) 
a = 10
